# QUESTION

A Horse on the Phonepad:
             
Imagine you place a knight chess piece on a phone dial pad. 
This chess piece moves in an uppercase “L” shape: two steps 
horizontally followed by one vertically, or one step horizontally 
then two vertically. 

Pay no attention to the poorly-redacted star and pound keys

Suppose you dial keys on the keypad using only hops a knight can make. 
Every time the knight lands on a key, we dial that key and make another 
hop. The starting position counts as being dialed.


Your mission:

Write a software that solves the following question:

How many distinct numbers can you dial in N hops from a particular 
starting position?
